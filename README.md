## Usage

### User Signup/Login
Users can sign up and log in to the app securely. JWT is used to manage authentication and authorization.

### Real-time Bidding
Real-time updates are achieved using `socket.io`. When a user places a bid, all connected clients receive an instant update.

#### Example:
```javascript
// Client-side example using React and socket.io-client
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:your_socket_port');

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to server');
});

socket.on('bid update', (data) => {
  console.log('New bid received:', data);
});

// To place a bid
socket.emit('place bid', { userId: 'user123', bidAmount: 500 });
```

### Auction Creation
Users can create new auctions for stocks. The created auctions are stored in the MongoDB database and are available for real-time bidding.

### Notifications
Users receive real-time notifications for various events such as winning an item or updates on auctions they are participating in.

### Error Handling
The app includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. All errors are logged and appropriate messages are displayed to the users.
